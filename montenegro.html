								<h1>2nd Part of the Tour<br />
								</h1>
								<p>I was in Montenegro for a while before I returned home form the waterpolo tour. I was in Montenegro for a lot longer than the time I spent in Spain. The water was beautiful. Our resort was right on the water, and we had a pool right on the water. We had the ability to walk from our resort to the pool, and it was a very short ish walk. </p>

							<div class="image main"><img src="photos/Montenegro/Poolcastle.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								Moving from Spain to Montenegro was a significant cultural shift. I was used to being able to talk with the local people in Spanish and understand what people said. Now people were talking all around me in a language that I didn't understand, and it was the first time in the entire tour I truly felt like a tourist.<br>
I didn't like it in Montenegro. The heat was overwhelming, and with all the training I had, I didn't have the energy to do any touristy stuff. Where the pool was located, there was a castle looking over it, and it looked very cool. With all the older buildings in Europe (castles, and old towns), that was a different experience than you get from being in Barcelona and Australia in general.<br>
We visited some blue caves on a boat one day, and it was quite an experience, especially with the 'cliff jumping' we did. It wasn't off a cliff, but it was very similar and quite fun.
