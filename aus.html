									<h1>Austria<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Out of all the countries I visted, Austria was the most beautiful. However, it was a very short lived trip. We only stayed for a 8 hour stop over. We were on our way to Croatia, and we had a stop for a few hours and dicided to explore the city of Vienna.</p>

									When we arrived in Vienna, we decided that the best way to get around the city was to use public transport. We took the train from the airport to Stephansplatz. It took a bit of time to understand what was going on because Austria is a German-speaking country, making it challenging to navigate the public transport system. <br> 
									The train ride was excellent. Considering it was public transport, it seemed like a private ride. The seats were extremely comfy, and there were places to put your carry-on bags and free on-board wifi. The ride from the city to the airport offered some stunning views of the countryside. Something that I noticed was that they loved their classical music. The ads were curated using famous classical pieces and classical music at the train station. As an avid cello player, I loved the city that appreciated the beauty of music. <br> 
									Once we got to St. Stephen's Cathedral, we went into the Cathedral to see its true magnificence. It was stunning. No church in Western Australia can compare to the Cathedral. The fact that it was started to be built in 1137, almost 1,000 years ago, was a humbling reminder of the rich history and culture of Vienna. <br> 
									Due to the nature of Stephansplatz being in the geological center of Vienna, all the old famous buildings were within walking distance. We walked past the Peterskirche, the oldest church in Vienna. There was a wedding going on. It was thought to be built by Charlemagne around 800.
