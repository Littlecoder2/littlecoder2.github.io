									<h1>Bosnia<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Unlike croatia and other old yugoslavian countries, Bosnia is a very different country. It is a very different culture and a very different way of life. The croats have succeded into modernising their country, and Bosnia is still a very traditional country.</p>

								<p>
									We visited the southern region of Bosnia. It has many people who identify themselves as Croats. You have to realise that Bosnia is a splintered country. It has three different presidents. It has three distinct ethnic groups: the Serbians, the Croats, and the Bosniaks. The Bosniaks are the biggest ethnic group in Bosnia. The Serbians are the second biggest ethnic group in Bosnia. The Croats are the third biggest ethnic group in Bosnia.<br>
									However, it is supposed to be an even distribution of the population's ethic groups. It is supposed to be 33% of each ethnic group. But it's more 50% Bosniaks, 30% Serbians, and 20% Croats. It has an unfortunate history with the scars of the war in the 1990s still present in the minds of the people. There is very high corruption, and with the three different presidents, it is tough to make them agree on anything, causing bills and laws to pass through the government extremely hard.<br>
									None of the political issues detracts from the country's beauty. It has such a range of climate, with the Herzegovina region being very similar to the Croatian region in appearance.<br>
									 However, the food is quite different from what Croatia is. Bosnia was under Ottoman rule for 4 centuries, during which the Ottomans had a significant influence on the country's food and culture. Croatia has a predominantly Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian population, whereas Bosnia has a significantly different religious composition. Due to the Ottoman occupation, it is a majority muslim country. It shares many dishes with Turkey, including their coffee drinking habits.<br>
									One of the most interesting things about Bosnia is the fact that it is a very different country to Croatia. It is a very different culture and a very different way of life. The croats have succeded into modernising their country, and Bosnia is still a very traditional country.
