									<h1>The Land of the Tourists<br />
									</h1>
									<p>The first thing that stood out to me upon our arrival in Croatia was the beauty of the water. We spent a while in Cavtat and Korcula, and our days were centered around a local water polo tournament. The atmosphere was incredible, and it was an excellent opportunity to compete against some local teams.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="photos/Croatia/Dubrovnikchapel.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									After the tournament, we spent an additional 11 days in Dubrovnik. The city was very different from what I was used to in Australia and even Barcelona; it felt like stepping back in time with all the old stone walls and historic architecture.<br>
									I got to meet up with my aunt for six days, and together we explored the city. It was cool to have some family around and share the experience with her, going sightseeing and enjoying the local culture.<br>
									Dubrovnik was packed with tourists. The city was bustling with people from all over the world, a stark contrast to my experience in Montenegro. There, I had felt like a tourist because of the language barrier, but in Dubrovnik, it felt like we were all there to appreciate the city's beauty. One of the reasons for the crowds was that Dubrovnik served as a filming location for the very popular show Game of Thrones. It was cool to see some of the places I recognized from the show, and it made the city even more of a big destination for fans.
