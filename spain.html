									<h1>España</h1>
									<p>When we first came to Spain, it was quite a shock. I understood what people said, yet somehow I still didn't understand what was going on around me. It took a while for my ears to catch on to what was happening. Eventually, I got the hang of it, and I could start to understand people. The Spanish accent put me off quite a bit.</p>

									We stayed in the beautiful northern part of Barcelona, in a quaint area known as "Pirme de Mar," which translates to "First to the Sea." Our accommodation was ideally located just 20 meters from the sparkling Mediterranean, allowing us quick and easy access to the beach, where we could hear the gentle waves lapping against the shore. <br>
									Our schedule was packed, leaving little room for leisurely activities, but we made the most of our mornings. We would typically rise early, around 7 a.m., to embark on invigorating runs and outdoor workouts. Physical fitness was a priority for us, and we often trained rigorously, engaging in a variety of exercises outside, taking advantage of the warm Mediterranean climate. <br>
									Water polo was the primary focus of our trip. Our day typically begins with physical exercise in the morning for 2 hours. We participated in games right before lunch, followed by another match later in the evening. By the time we went to bed at midnight, we had often clocked up to 7 hours of intense exercise each day. Maintaining a healthy weight proved to be a challenge; even though we were eating frequently, I managed to lose around 4 kg during our time there. The rapid calorie burn made it nearly impossible to replenish the energy we expended. <br>
									One of the highlights of our trip was participating in a prestigious tournament against some of the most renowned water polo clubs in the world. Competing at such a high level was an incredible experience, and I learned immensely from interacting with top athletes. During our stay, we had the privilege of visiting some of Barcelona's most famed clubs and pools, which boasted spectacular facilities that were both inspiring and breathtaking. <br>
									In addition to our training and competitions, we had the chance to escape to the Catalan countryside for a day. This was an unforgettable experience, as it was my first opportunity to see charming towns that date back to the Middle Ages. We spent the day driving toward the French border, exploring historical villages with cobbled streets and ancient architecture. Lunchtime was a highlight, as we were able to dine in one of these picturesque towns, relishing delicious local cuisine and soaking in the rich culture. This excursion turned out to be one of my favourite parts of the trip, even more so than my experiences in Montenegro, offering a refreshing change of pace and a deeper connection to the region's history.
